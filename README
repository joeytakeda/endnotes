## Endnotes 2017

This repository contains the code for Endnotes 2017 conference scheduling, website, and nametag production. It was initially prepared not for re-use, so it comes as-is, with little documentation or explanation, unfortunately. 

To run this code, you should have ANT. You can run it at the command line like so:

``
cd your/directory/for/this/repo
ant -lib utilities
``
