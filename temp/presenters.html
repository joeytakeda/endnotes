“Outside Art, Inside History: The History of Modern and
Contemporary Art in Korea”</div>
</td>
<td class="s0" dir="ltr">The word “Baggat” means outside or the
outdoors in Korean. For artists in South Korea during the 1980s,
however, it meant being outside of all ideologies. With the cities
under heavy surveillance by the authoritarian regime, artists began
searching for an alternative space outside of the city, of art
institutions, and therefore of all confinements. Rivers and fields
were, for these artists, a possibility for freedom which allowed
for far more experimental forms of art. Thus emerged artistic
practices that centered on a more physical, direct, and subjective
dialogue with nature, pioneered primarily by two groups which were
both formed in 1981: the Korea Nature Art’s Association (or Yatoo)
and the Baggat Art Group. Baggat artists emphasized
site-specificity and participation, often having exhibitions in the
form of festivals as a means of highlighting the presence and
engagement of audience members. Following the foundation of a
democratic government in 1987, however, artists of the Baggat Art
Group were no longer in need to go out into the fields in order to
achieve freedom of expression. Thus they were faced with the urgent
question of how to adapt to this critical moment of sociopolitical
change.<br />
My paper will trace the history of the Baggat Art Group, placing
the 1997 exhibition, “The Exhibition of History and Environment,”
as a pivot in the group’s shifting dynamics. I propose that an
observation of how the Baggat Art Group has continued to rewrite
itself into dominant narratives of art allows for a more
comprehensive understanding of modern and contemporary art in South
Korea. This project therefore adopts and attempts to support the
group’s objective of incorporating what is outside into the inside,
transcending the limitations of existing boundaries, and to
expanding the category of art by realizing what resides at its
borders.</td>

<td class="s1" dir="ltr">“Food Fight: An Eggsistential Tale”</td>
<td class="s1" dir="ltr">What is the relationship of food to our
cultural identity? What does it mean for food to be “culturally
authentic”? Are there certain foods and identities that border on
the edge of cultural authenticity and do they cause “unease”? In
this short stop animation film, an Egg Tart comes to life in a
Canadian kitchen. They are made to answer the question, “Where are
you really from?”. A cast of culinary characters like a British
Scone, a Portuguese Pasteis de Nata, and a Chinese Bao battle over
the origins of the pastry. This leaves the Egg Tart wondering about
their own sense of identity and the need to define it. <span style=
"font-style:italic;">Food Fight: An Eggsistential Tale</span> is
inspired by questions about the relationship between food, history,
cultural identity and cultural consumption. My accompanying paper
for the film will be grounded in Rey Chow’s theory on the three
levels of mimeticism. According to Chow, mimeticism consists of
“the overlapping layers of projection, automization, and
self-ethnicization involved in the articulation of the ethnic
subject and ethnic culture as such” (126). As a result of external
projections of the cultural norm, mimeticism becomes a process of
internalized other-ness for the marked ethnic. This paper will then
suggest ways in which cultural production like film can both
portray and perhaps question the mechanisms of mimeticism. In other
words, is it possible to push the borders of problematic social
frameworks within the frame of the projected screen?</td>

<div class="softmerge-inner" style="width: 13184px; left: -1px;">
For Endnotes 2017, I am proposing to contribute a conversation
surrounding a series of photographs that I created along the Canada
/ U.S. international boundary between 2012 and 2015.<br />
<br />
Stretching 8,891 kilometres from Tsawwassen, British Columbia to
Campobello, New Brunswick (including 2,475 kilometres shared with
Alaska), the border between Canada and the United States of America
represents the world’s longest shared land boundary. This line
travels between town sites and wilderness, and is visibly
demarcated by a six-metre-wide swath of cleared land amongst the
forest, and over 5,500 granite, steel, or concrete obelisks called
‘monuments’. While this border is often referred to as
‘undefended’, it is through technological advancements in
surveillance that the boundary is monitored.<br />
<br />
My pictures emphasize the space in which these two countries rub up
against one another. Examples of my interests include the enclaves
of Northwest Angle and Point Roberts, peace parks and gardens,
disused or abandoned crossing points and roadways, and First
Nations territories that are considered sovereign regions
independent of both Canada and the United States. The photographs
in Borderline establish a bucolic landscape that is typical of the
North American frontier. These pictures stand in contrast to our
collective imagination surrounding the term ‘border’, which
conjures up imagery of more heavily militarized zones of separation
such as Israel’s Green Line, the Indo- Pakistani Line of Control,
or the Korean Demilitarized Zone.<br />
<br />
In the context of this conference, my presentation of Borderline
will engage with the concept of the border as an aesthetic model,
investigating the various objects and formations that delineate the
boundary. The explicit nature of the border as defined
cartographically will be juxtaposed with my experiences ‘on the
ground’, which are subjective,<br />
leading to the construct of the international boundary as a
permeable space.</div>

<td class="s5" dir="ltr">“Labouring from the Periphery: The
Editor's Preface in Early Print Chaucer”</td>
<td class="s5" dir="ltr">In early print Chaucer scholarship,
paratexts have proven to be fruitful subjects for analysis in
studies concerning the changing cultural meanings of literature and
authorship in early modern England. As recent books by Alexandra
Gillespie (2006) and Kevin Pask (2005) suggest, these paratextual
spaces, positioned on the borders of literary and other works,
present an opportunity for the more marginal figures of literary
production such as editors to influence the reception of those
texts they help to produce. This essay, however, aims to highlight
the figure of the editor not by focusing on how he frames the
primary work or author, but by examining how he uses the peripheral
space of the paratext to conceive of his own role and position
within the changing field of textual production. Considering the
editions of Chaucer put into print by William Caxton (1483),
William Thynne (1532), and Thomas Speght (1598), I trace how these
editors use the prefatory paratext as a space in which to
creatively reimagine the literary tradition in terms that validate
their own labour. Specifically, I argue that these representations
come increasingly to favour intellectual over physical labour, a
shift that corresponds to the specialization of the editor’s role
and his separation from the work of printing. I conclude that the
preface, as mobilized by early modern editors of Chaucer, shapes
not only the text that it borders but also influences the reader to
value specific forms of work that go into its production.</td>

Anti-hypocrisy”</td>
<td class="s6 softmerge" dir="ltr">
<div class="softmerge-inner" style="width: 13184px; left: -1px;">
Critics who deign to take Henry David Thoreau seriously as a
political theorist invariably note a disjuncture, if not a
contradiction, at the centre of his political thought. Thus
scholarly debate about Thoreau's politics typically hangs on
whether Thoreau's political thought is best represented by the case
for individual withdrawal in Walden, or by his defense of civil
disobedience in his more overtly political writings. The hackneyed
response to this seeming inconsistency is the accusation of
hypocrisy that has always featured in responses to Thoreau's
writings. However, drawing on Hegel's response to romantic ethics,
I argue that it is ironically Thoreau's anti-hypocrisy that
underwrites this inconsistency.<br />
Thoreau saw participation in a corrupted society as a form of
hypocritical complicity in its evils and held obeying one's
conscience to be the only means of maintaining integrity. However,
for Thoreau, like Hegel, judgments of conscience require their
communication and their recognition by the other—and the others
comprising the social—to escape accusations of self-serving
hypocrisy and be affirmed as moral. We can thus see the double-bind
in which Thoreau's anti-hypocrisy places him: Thoreau's writings
evince a belief that avoiding the hypocrisy of involvement in a
society fundamentally at odds with one's principles entails the
hypocrisy of a retreat into romantic solipsism that does not seek
social recognition of its conscientious moral deliberations.
Thoreau invents a communicative strategy as an attempt to free
himself from this political and moral impasse: the Thoreauvian
jeremiad serves as a shaming of his countrymen that reorients the
affective force of sentimental literature's logic of sympathy away
from an imaginary synthesis of individuals and towards a
reassertion of the boundaries between self and other, or self and
society. Ashamed of his vulnerability to the moral contagion of
hypocritical society, Thoreau lights upon this rhetorical strategy
of shaming, which ultimately underlines the limits of his political
thinking, writing, and actions.</div>

<td class="s9" dir="ltr">“Giordano Bruno in Geneva”</td>
<td class="s9" dir="ltr">This piece is a chapter from a longer work
of fiction, tentatively titled <span style="font-style:italic;">The
Shadows of Ideas</span>, which follows the poet and philosopher
Giordano Bruno (1548-1600) in his travels through an early modern
Europe rife with religious persecution and ideological schism.
Bruno was an avid proponent of the Copernican model of the solar
system, but reached an even more radical conclusion: he claimed
that the universe was limitless, and that countless other planets
orbited countless other suns. His theological beliefs, perhaps best
described as pantheistic, led to his excommunication by the
Catholic Church, the Calvinists in Geneva, and the Lutherans in
Helmstadt. He was executed by the Inquisition on charges of heresy
in 1600. My work attempts to reconstruct Bruno’s life and world in
a way that does justice to its inner and outer complexity. Rather
than a “martyr to science,” as earlier commentators often cast him,
I see Bruno as a product of his contradictory times, coming to
startlingly “modern” conclusions about a boundless universe using
systems of thought much older and stranger than what we now know as
“science.” He was also an ex-Dominican monk, a scholar travelling
from university to university in search of better prospects, a
Neapolitan rejected by a xenophobic Oxford for his Italian accent,
and sometimes even an almost David-Blaine-like figure, courting the
attention of kings and luminaries by offering to teach them “magic”
– in this case a memory system incorporating a series of imaginary
concentric wheels. The excerpted piece describes Bruno’s initial
entry into the Calvinist stronghold of Geneva in 1578 – his first
time living in a Protestant country. He seeks help from fellow
Italian refugees, finds work as a typesetter, enrolls in the
university, and soon falls under the scrutiny of the Consistory – a
body much like the Inquisition he has just fled.</td>

“‘She Blushes at the Insult’: Undressing the Modest Countenance in
Thomas Hardy’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Far from the
Madding Crowd</span>”</div>
</td>
<td class="s0" dir="ltr">One of the most difficult human
expressions to feign, the blush has long been a source of cultural
fascination and anxiety insofar as it seems to be the body’s
betrayal of the mind — an involuntarily visible expression of
internal feeling. By blushing, the body speaks, and yet the message
conveyed is often ambiguous, since blushes can express a range of
seemingly antithetical emotions, from innocent embarrassment to
shame. Through an examination of Thomas Hardy’s detailed
descriptions of Bathsheba Everdene’s blushes in <span style=
"font-style:italic;">Far from the Madding Crowd</span>, this paper
will suggest that Hardy positions his heroine’s shifting facial hue
as a site of ambiguity and fascination that both invites and
resists interpretation. Insofar as Bathsheba’s most enigmatic and
closely scrutinized blushes coincide with her three courtships, I
position my reading of her countenance in the context of cultural
and literary histories of the “modest blush,” a marker of virgin
innocence haunted by eroticism and shame. Alongside these
convoluted and often contradictory connotations surrounding the
modest blush, moreover, I consider nineteenth-century developments
in the physiology of blushing — developments that destabilized
cultural and literary conceptions of the blush as a signifier of
moral character and conceived of it instead as a marker of
self-consciousness in relation to social opinion. Increasingly
understood as a physiological response to arbitrary social stimuli,
the blush is simultaneously subversive, excessive, and
ideologically bound, representing a site of slippage between
manners and biology. Through Bathsheba’s blushes, which
paradoxically signal her modesty by drawing attention to the body
she has been taught to conceal, <span style=
"font-style:italic;">Far from the Madding Crowd</span> both asserts
and undermines conventional restrictions on female behaviour and
sexuality.</td>

<td class="s5" dir="ltr">“Places in Things: Meaning and
Representation in the World(s) of <span style=
"font-style:italic;">Pearl</span>”</td>
<td class="s5" dir="ltr">As editor Sarah Stanbury writes in her
introduction to the text, the medieval English poem <span style=
"font-style:italic;">Pearl</span> is “a story of crossing-over, the
stepping out from the ordinary life into a parallel universe where
things operate by different natural laws.” As the narrator of the
poem grapples with grief and loss, borders are probed and crossed
in a way that indeed suggests a parallel universe: the experiences
of the narrator, far-ranging though they are, occupy a single,
bounded piece of space and time. This paper seeks to examine how
layered borders and category slippage in <span style=
"font-style:italic;">Pearl</span> create a heterotopic space in
which multiple meanings are woven together, but are never reduced
to a single comprehensive experience. The uneasiness that results
from this lack of resolution creates a dialogue that stretches
beyond the pages of the text and raises questions about the nature
of physical and metaphysical boundaries: what are the differences
between waking, sleeping, and death? what limits human
understanding of the divine? and how can writers and readers make
meaning in a world where nothing seems exactly as it is? This paper
will also interrogate that which, in Bill Brown’s words, “may still
lurk in the shadows of the ballroom”: the pearls and gardens and
rivers that we look through in our quest to understand the poem,
but that, when looked at, suggest other, more deeply hidden borders
delineating the relationships between people, things, landscapes,
and the divine. The lurking things that populate the poem offer
commentary on the difficulties of representation in the parallel
universes of text and meaning, and on the borders crossed and
created by the act of interpretation.</td>

protect the mentally ill often reinforce their isolation. Focusing
in particular on the regulations in place under Alberta’s Assured
Income for the Severely Handicapped (AISH), the exclusion of
pre-existing conditions in healthcare plans such as Alberta Blue
Cross, and the significant economic and social barriers that
prevent equitable access to mental healthcare, Loopholes

Lady</span>”</td>
<td class="s0" dir="ltr">In the introduction to Issue 71 of
<span style="font-style:italic;">Social Text</span>, sociologist
Alondra Nelson says that in “popular mythology” around technology
and the future, “blackness gets constructed as always oppositional
to technologically driven chronicles of progress” (1). Afrofuturist
creators like Janelle Monáe work to combat this mythology by
treating black people and blackness itself as technological and
futuristic. In their paper “Now We Want Our Funk Cut”, Daylanne K.
English and Alvin Kim note that while much Afrofuturist music has
allowed black male artists to “[perform] black masculinity in a
relatively unrestrained way, neither black femininity not an
underlying gender binary” is allowed the same freedom (221). What
sets Monáe’s album, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Electric
Lady</span>, apart from the work of other Afrofuturist creators
before her is her use of song to create black feminist futures.
Monáe’s work builds off a history of Afrofuturist musicians like
P-Funk and George Clinton, as well as written feminist Afrofuturism
such as work by Octavia Butler, combining both traditions to create
feminist futures for black women in music. Beyond pushing the
boundaries of genre and the masculinist expectations of
Afrofuturism in her work, reading <span style=
"font-style:italic;">The Electric Lady</span> as a text also blurs
the line between musicology and English literature studies. My
paper will explore how Monáe is able to use the multiple modalities
of sound to create a complex Afrofuturist world that allows myriad
visions for black womanhood without denying the legacy of blackness
in our own time.</td>

“Embodied Trauma and the Bibliographic Form in <span style=

"font-style:italic;">The Place of Scraps</span>”</div>
</td>
<td class="s0" dir="ltr">Trauma is a central theme in Jonathan
Safran Foer’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Tree of Codes</span>
and Jordan Abel’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Place of
Scraps</span>, both of which use previous texts as their base to
create a new narrative through an erasure of the old. Foer, a
grandchild of Holocaust survivors, uses Jewish author Bruno Schulz’
1934 short story collection <span style="font-style:italic;">Street
of Crocodiles</span> as his original text, cutting out swaths of
words and sentences until a skeleton narrative remains. Schulz
never survived World War II, and Foer’s novel strives to represent
the trauma of the Holocaust and attempted erasure of his people
through the altered book and narrative. Abel, a Nisga’a author,
uses anthropologist Marius Barbeau’s 1950 anthology <span style=
"font-style:italic;">Totem Poles</span> as his base, yet his method
and aim severely diverges from Foer’s. Rather than cutting, Abel
erases parts of Barbeau’s narrative and adds his own interspersed
recollections, both reclaiming a colonialist, racist narrative and
representing the empty spaces left in his and other Indigenous
peoples’ lives due to Canada’s silencing and cultural, genocidal
erasure of Indigenous populations. When visualized in narrative
form, trauma usually takes either a comic form, or it becomes the
work of documentary films. These two novels, however, take it upon
the bibliographic form to represent trauma, silence, and
remembrance, which allows for multiple layers in their depiction of
trauma, from lingual to spatial to physical. In their unique forms
yet poignant differences, <span style="font-style:italic;">Tree of
Codes</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Place of
Scraps</span> expose the power of the book’s bibliographic form to
release, understand, and remember intergenerational trauma through
language, space, and physicality, working towards embedding the
past in the present and highlighting a visceral emotional reaction
to collective trauma.</td>

“‘Japan is coming to us’: Discouraging Ecocosmopolitanism when

"font-style:italic;">A Tale for the Time Being</span> and John
Bolton’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Debris</span>”</div>
</td>
<td class="s0" dir="ltr">Following the devastating 2011 tsunami in
Japan, the connective nature of the Pacific Ocean brought Japanese
debris to British Columbia (BC)’s coastline. In Ozeki’s novel and
Bolton’s film, these objects lead to the investigation of the
stories of their owners, and allow the Canadian artists to embark
on their own journeys of self-discovery. While discussing this
disaster, Ozeki and Bolton touch on the particular vulnerability of
BC to a similar event. As well, the novel and film spend as much,
if not more, time detailing the effects of what is in the ocean due
to the tsunami – radiation from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power
plant, invasive species, and garbage – as they do honouring the
lives lost. Admittedly, it is difficult to silo these issues from
the event that led to them. With that in mind, this paper asks the
following questions: How do borders affect the way we memorialize
lives? What are the rhetorical issues when a Canadian artist
represents the natural disaster of another country? Most
importantly, should this tragedy be viewed through an
ecocosmopolitan lens or is it harmful that global collectivity is
introduced to understand and mourn this tragedy?<br />
<br />
To provide responses to these questions, the paper will first
establish a theoretical framework, outlining the rhetoric of memory
and public memorials as well as the work of ecocritical theorists
Ursula Heise and Karen Thornber. It will then challenge the use of
the word ‘safe’ to describe BC; both Ozeki and Bolton explicitly
discuss this safety. It will argue that when the artifacts from the
tsunami become heavily curated from a Canadian viewpoint, which is
one of fear for BC’s safety, there is the risk that victims of
natural disasters become reduced to found objects and warning signs
of things to come on the BC coastline.</td>

<td class="s0" dir="ltr">Within the Renaissance and Reformation
culture of early modern England, Edmund Spenser and John Milton
borrowed the interpretive strategies (grammatical hermeneutics) of
Erasmus (and co.) in writing poetry that breathed new life into
biblical fictions. The poets and schoolmasters and all the scholars
of the humanities appeared to Erasmus's opponents to be the true
beneficiaries of his Christian humanist approach to biblical
interpretation (exegesis). Erasmus was accused of exalting the
tribe of poet over that of the (proper, Scholastic and
Aristotelian) theologian. Erasmus, unlike Luther and Calvin and
other Reformers, left no church to carry forward an institutional
version of his (rhetorical) theology. Some of the strangest and
most challenging theological aspects of Spenser and Milton's
oeuvre, however, do make spectacular use of Erasmian exegetical
method. Spenser and Milton's visionary depictions of Wisdom (in the
<span style="font-style:italic;">Fowre Hymnes</span> and
<span style="font-style:italic;">Paradise Lost</span> respectively)
as Judeo-Christian and classicizing muse are eloquent monuments to
Erasmian influence and to the perennial permeability of the border
dividing poet and theologian.</td>

Margery Kempe”</td>
<td class="s5" dir="ltr">In my presentation, I will discuss
boundaries between secular and religious values and orthodoxy and
heresy in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Book of Margery
Kempe</span>. Considered to be the first autobiography in English,
<span style="font-style:italic;">The Book of Margery Kempe</span>
tells the story of Margery Kempe, a fourteenth century woman who
experienced extraordinary visions and who became a famous (and
notorious) religious mystic. Margery Kempe travelled by herself to
Europe and the Middle East, and spoke with some of the most
powerful religious figures of her time. She aroused controversy
through her copious weeping and speaking of her visions, and was
eventually arrested and put on trial for heresy. My master’s thesis
is a play based on Margery Kempe’s life. I incorporate insights
from recent psychological studies into my play to engage with
contemporary issues such as mental illness and the stigmatization
of the mentally ill. I relate Margery Kempe’s experience to that of
individuals today who experience visions and who are diagnosed with
conditions such as schizophrenia, temporal lobe epilepsy, and
postnatal psychosis and depression. In my presentation, I will
discuss the clash between psychological and religious
interpretations of Margery Kempe’s visions, and how my play
juxtaposes medieval religious beliefs with modern neuroscience and
psychology. I will also discuss why Margery Kempe’s gender and
status as a middle class woman made her a figure of controversy in
the eyes of the medieval Church, and why many religious and secular
leaders attempted to silence her and even to have her burned at the
stake. Many in the Church saw Margery as an outsider and a threat
to traditional Christian values. I will talk about why Margery
Kempe’s story is relevant in the modern era, and how the hostility
and backlash she faced ties in to patriarchal structures and
ideologies that oppress women today.</td>

“NATURALIZAÇÃO POR DESPOSSESSÃO? Reprodução social-natural na
Comunidade Quilombola Barro Vermelho”</div>
</td>
<td class="s0" dir="ltr">Barro Vermelho is a traditional community
from Brazil; they have occupied their territory for about 300
years. Recently, recognizing the local nature exuberance, the
provincial government decreed the creation of an environmental park
there. According to the law, people cannot live in conservation
areas, so, the community is under pressure to leave their
territory. This paper is inspired on my ongoing doctoral thesis,
which analyzes this conflict in which the state uses an
environmental preservation argument to displace people who are,
actually, the most able to preserve. Ideally, these people should
receive their preservation services instead of being pressured to
leave. In this article I will describe the territory (based on my
fieldwork) as an essential part of the community's way of life in
many ways, including economically, through the use of river water
for various activities, agricultural subsistence, and artisanal
food manufacturing derivative (oils, soap, flour). Thus, it is
necessary to discuss the idea of nature (as something isolated)
behind public policies. Moreover, it is necessary to rethink the
idea of poverty, since if the community had free access to the
territory and support for proper environmental management, even
with little monetary income, they would not be in any way poor, and
they would have achieved their goals of having land and
autonomy.</td>

Links between prisons and borders are multiple. Angela Davis,
notably, describes the prison as border (Davies &amp; Dent, 2001),
and the two institutions have been framed as an interconnected
process of criminalization, producing and policing social
difference (Lloyd et al, 2012). My thesis argues that the meeting
point between prisons and cultural production in contemporary Spain
can help shape prison as borderland rather than border, creating a
space for dialogue between otherwise unconnected groups. Within
cultural theory, borderlands have been articluated as sites of
subversion and hybridity (Canclini, Gómez Peña, Anzaldúa), and just
as borderlands are initially defined by their borders, but become
something else, prisons are defined by their walls, but can we
understand them, instead, as sites of mixing and bridging? The
presence of movement, or lack thereof, constitutes a fundamental
part of the meaning of prisons. They are, at once, places in
constant flux and places of 'stuck-ness', introducing a fragility,
but also potential for change and transition. In this presentation,
my consideration of prison as borderland begins with a brief
introduction to current and past cultural projects in Spanish
prisons, then focuses on the work of Elena Cánovas and the
prison-based theatre group Teatro Yeses to examine themes of
belonging and exclusion in contemporary Spain. As well as a general
overview of the project, which was brought to the attention of a
wider public in the 2008 film <span style="font-style:italic;">El
patio de mi cárcel</span>, I focus on two texts: <span style=
"font-style:italic;">La balada de la cárcel de Circe</span> (2000)
and <span style="font-style:italic;">El más preciado bien que nos
dieron los cielos</span> (2005). These works specifically draw
attention to the concept of 'threshold' and the subject of
movement, especially as it relates to border crossings, both
literally, in their discussion of immigration, and symbolically, in
their dialogue with cultural and literary traditions.</div>

hierarchies with collectivities to reveal humanism’s

cosmopolitanism as an alternative to anthropocentric forms of

<td class="s0" dir="ltr">“The Threshold of Love: Between ‘You’ and
‘I’”</td>
<td class="s0" dir="ltr">For this presentation, I will be looking
at love as a threshold—as a space that is performed between an “I”
and a “you”. While I will look at some historical examples of love,
specifically romantic love, my critique will focus on
representations of dystopian love in contemporary fiction. I will
consider the generative possibilities of looking through the
dystopian lens as it suggests love as a certain kind of social
agreement that is often read as increasingly corrupt in a
contemporary world. And yet, love is also perceived as a tool for
healing. Love then inhabits a variety of border spaces: can love
ever pass by or through its own space as a threshold? While the
boundaries and borders of time have changes, it is as though love
has been seized in a stasis—in a determination to maintain an
entrenched status quo. In <span style=
"font-style:italic;">CommonWealth</span>, Michael Hardt and Antonio
Negri claim, “Every act of love… is an ontological event in that it
marks a rupture” (181). In their radicalization of Western culture,
love must be a “dynamic of multiple singularities” (183), but I
would like to suggest that love is a ritual, a repetition in which
we recognize love as a conditioning that lives on the border of
complex and complicated biological urges. Love, itself, functions
as a bridge. Although sometimes burning, love as a bridge also
marks the possibility of connection. It is a path that connects a
“me” to “you.” But, how does making that trek across a moving and
moveable boundary reconstitute “ourselves”? How does love blur the
boundary between an “I” and a “you”? These are some of the
questions I will be addressing by looking at Arundhati Roy’s
<span style="font-style:italic;">The God of Small Things</span>,
Margaret Atwood’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Oryx and
Crake</span>, and Zadie Smith’s <span style=

<td class="s6 softmerge" dir="ltr">
<div class="softmerge-inner" style="width: 13484px; left: -1px;">
Quentin Tarantino’s 2013 Spaghetti Western film <span style=
"font-style:italic;">Django Unchained</span>, and Frederick
Douglass’s 1852 short historical fiction piece, “The Heroic Slave,”
offer incomplete, underdeveloped, diminishing — and in the case of
Tarantino, damaging — narrativizations of their main female
characters. Hildi, wife of Django, and Susan, wife of the heroic
figure of the Creole rebellion, Madison Washington, appear in each
narrative as accompaniments to, objects of, and motivation for
their husbands’ pursuits of freedom and vengeance. As such objects,
they are silenced and simplified, with Hildi even bodily exploited.
However, my paper proposes that to varying degrees, Hildi and Susan
break through their silences, diminutizations, and exploitations,
especially when read alongside one another. When read in tandem,
these characters offer more spaces for audiences to read their
actions and inactions — as well as their oversights in
characterization— as content propulsive in the discussion of
locating and representing their own individualized, self-defined
forms of humanity and resistance. My argument complicates
definitions of and expectations for “humanity” and “resistance,”
and isolates instances of their assertions by Hildi and Susan. My
study also identifies the inherent limitations surrounding the
attempt to understand humanity and resistance regarding these
characters. It is concerned with the representation of female
characters in slave narratives, when sites of “humanity” are
structured around universalized and overrepresented whiteness, and
thus are often constructed to serve a white audience. The argument
holds that in each narrative, these characters offer more than
motivations for their husbands’ heroisms; further, they are much
more than sources of emotional leverage to be had over an audience.
Their silences demand that they be read not simply as exclusions to
or exploitations within the male dominated and male constructed
narratives in which they are placed, but as active agents working
against the interlocking machines of colonialist terror and
patriarchal oppression.</div>

<div class="softmerge-inner" style="width: 12248px; left: -1px;">In
Frantz Fanon’s exposition of the colony in <span style=
"font-style:italic;">The Wretched of the Earth</span>, Frantz Fanon
describes colonial space as a Manichean world, wherein the colony
is neatly divided in two: the space of the colonizer and that of
the colonized. True decolonization, being as Fanon roughly
describes, a violent enterprise, doesn’t intend to bridge the gap
between the two worlds, rather it seeks to destroy the Manichean
geography of borders and boundaries, both satiating the desires of
the colonized and establishing social justice regarding the
distributions of and rights to lands. However, in the contemporary
post-colony, rather than the Manichean World being smashed, it is
continued, as Achilles Mbembe purports, under a new postcolonial
logic. In my project I hope to investigate how postcolonial urban
spaces, particularly urban Algeria and Israel/Palestine—through the
literary works of Tahar Djaout and Mahmoud Darwish—maintain a
Manichean world via the redistribution of urban geography, with the
creation of soft borders and social boundaries which produce new
territories , and redefines space into new places. This new urban
geography, imagined as a response to colonial hegemony, rather than
being shaped by race, ethnicity or class, is first and foremost
shaped by religion and religious ideology. In the cases on which I
focus, the delineation of urban spaces are often motivated by the
anxieties of barbarism, or the fear of barbarism. The acts of
pushing this barbarism to the periphery of borders, secluding it
within allotted spaces, or controlling and limiting its movement is
a postcolonial reproduction of a “mission civilisatrice”, which
rewards the acceptable civilized religious ideology as the ideology
of ease and free movement. In secluding those which perform
“barbarism”, this type of geography, which produces apartheid,
develops a barbarian society, as Todorov asserts in Fear of the
Barbarians.</div>

<td class="s0" dir="ltr">This paper employs Sarah Juliet Lauro's

Francavilla’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Afterlife with

“Ambiguous Narration, Unstable Identities, and Liminal Affects in
Henry James’ <span style="font-style:italic;">The Turn of the
Screw</span>”</div>
</td>
<td class="s0" dir="ltr">Throughout <span style=
"font-style:italic;">The Turn of the Screw</span>, Henry James uses
images of thresholds and states of ambiguity to evoke terror in
both his characters and his readers. This paper will examine the
liminality of spaces, affects, and identities in James’s novella in
order to show how the governess’s fragmented sense of self becomes
projected into her external environment and replicated through the
reader’s inability to fully piece the narrative together. While
there is abundant scholarship debating whether the governess’s
encounters with the ghosts are real or imagined, this paper will
argue that it is precisely through this pervasive ambiguity and
undecidability that the text becomes so unsettling. Tzvetan Todorov
suggests in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Poetics of
Prose</span> that this unsettling state of ambivalence is the very
site of terror and that while the “ambiguity is maintained
throughout the text […] it is not necessary to choose between the
two contrary solutions; the rule of the genre implies that the
ambiguity be maintained” (183). This paper will demonstrate that it
is precisely through this lack of certainty that James’s generates
terror in his text, as the reader is unable to contain his or her
accumulated knowledge and anxious speculation within any verifiable
explanation of events.</td>

<td class="s10" dir="ltr">I completed my undergraduate and post
graduate degrees in Hispanic studies from University of Delhi,
India. Currently I am working on my PhD dissertation, which focuses
on the contemporary Central American literary texts and argues that
fictions can be read as testimonio.</td>
<td class="s10" dir="ltr">“Language and Identity in Central
American Migrant Narratives”</td>
<td class="s10" dir="ltr">This presentation focuses on the kind of
role that language performs when it travels with immigrants beyond
borders to new lands. Language defines one’s identity in relation
to the social and cultural aspect of one’s nation. However, this
changes completely when one traverses the borders of that nation.
The identity and existence associated with the language in one’s
homeland gets redefined outside the national boundary. Languages,
also, follow hierarchy. For example, Spanish in Central America
carries authority and power when compared to the other indigenous
languages. Yet, when Spanish travels with immigrants to the United
States, it loses its power and authority to the English language
which hierarchically ranks superior there. Thus, when immigrants
travel from South to North, they not only struggle to establish
themselves in the new country (like, searching for jobs and
adapting to the new socio-cultural environment) but they also
grapple with their new identity based on the hierarchy of
languages. They sometimes lose the authority and power that they
enjoyed in their homeland because of the superiority of the
language that they practiced. For instance, in the fiction
<span style="font-style:italic;">The Tattooed Soldier</span> (1995)
by Hector Tobar, the protagonist Antonio who travels to the United
States from Guatemala relates his identity with that of his own
country. As he observes in the text, “[i]n Spanish, I sound like
the intelligent person I really am. In English, I am a bus boy”
(4). I will discuss two Central American texts—<span style=
"font-style:italic;">The Tattooed Soldier</span> (1995) by Hector
Tobar and <span style="font-style:italic;">Odyssey to the
North</span> (1998) by Mario Bencastro—and examine how Central
American immigrants strive against the hierarchy of languages that
they face in the United States not simply to understand or speak it
but also in reviewing their existence and identity in the new
land.</td>
